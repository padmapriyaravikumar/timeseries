⚡ Seasonal Energy Consumption Forecasting (SARIMA & SARIMAX)

This project forecasts monthly electricity consumption using time series models that capture seasonality and external influences such as temperature and festival/special events.

📌 Overview

Electricity usage shows strong seasonal behavior and is affected by external factors. This project applies:

SARIMA for seasonal forecasting

SARIMAX to improve accuracy by including exogenous variables

🧠 Models Used

SARIMA (seasonal patterns only)

SARIMAX (seasonality + exogenous variables)

🛠 Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

Statsmodels

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

📈 Key Features
